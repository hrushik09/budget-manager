# Budget Manager

This is a basic budget manager for reading purchases from the console and keeping track in a ```.txt``` file.
User should specify the type of transaction for each purchase:
- Food
- Clothes
- Entertainment
- Other

These are the options in the main menu:
1) Add income
2) Add purchase
3) Show list of purchases
4) Balance
5) Save
6) Load
7) Analyze (Sort)
0) Exit

- List of purchases can be shown as per type or all at once
- Sorting can be done in three ways:
  * Sort All – sort the entire shopping list and display it so that the most expensive purchases are at the top of the list.
  * Sort By Type – show which category eats the most money.
  * Sort Certain Type – same as Sort All, but for a specific category.
- Save and Load options will use the ```purchases.txt``` to save data to and load data from the file.
